# PlantText - Mac Native application


## Idea

Simple two pane UI with editor and live preview plantuml text with image output. OSX Native application, quicker preview (with Java Nailgun Server)

## MVP ~~TODO~~

  - [x] Editor & Viewer UI
  - [x] ~~Config - nailgun/jar config~~ bundle both jars
  - [x] Live Preview
  - [x] ~~Option to save image~~ autosave same path as source
